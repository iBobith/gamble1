# gamble1

Welcome to my first fully fledged project in C++! 

This is a little gambling game, which I'm hoping to produce as a part of a series of gambling games, designed to give you a quick boost in serotonin.

To play, it's quite simple: download the .zip file, extract it, go to ./x64/Debug, and run the gamble1.exe file! 

Your computer may prompt you to perform a virus scan, or that it refuses to download the file due to a potential virus, which is completely understandable. In that case, either don't bother with the scan or allow it on your device and enjoy the game. I give you my wordâ€”it's just a silly gambling game I spent WAY too much time making!

Another known issue is that when running the .exe file, you may get some .dll errors. This is because your computer doesnt have the necessary packages installed pertaining to C++. So to work around this, simply go to the link below, and download the appropriate version. Then, once it's done, you'll never encounter any problems like these ever again!
