# gamble1

Welcome to my first fully fledged project in C++! 
This is a little gambling game, which I'm hoping to produce as a part of a series of gambling games, designed to give you a quick boost in serotonin.
To play, it's quite simple: download the .zip file, extract it, go to ./x64/Debug, and run the gamble1.exe file! 
  Your computer may prompt you to perform a virus scan, or that it refuses to download the file due to a potential virus, which is completely understandable. In that case, either don't bother with the scan or allow it on your device and enjoy the game. I give you my wordâ€”it's just a silly gambling game I spent WAY too much time making!
